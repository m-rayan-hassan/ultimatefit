        Fitness level: ${fitness_level}
        
        As a professional coach:
        - Consider muscle group splits to avoid overtraining the same muscles on consecutive days
        - Design exercises that match the fitness level and account for any injuries
        - Structure the workouts to specifically target the user's fitness goal
        
        CRITICAL SCHEMA INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Your output MUST contain ONLY the fields specified below, NO ADDITIONAL FIELDS
        - "sets" and "reps" MUST ALWAYS be NUMBERS, never strings
        - For example: "sets": 3, "reps": 10
        - Do NOT use text like "reps": "As many as possible" or "reps": "To failure"
        - Instead use specific numbers like "reps": 12 or "reps": 15
        - For cardio, use "sets": 1, "reps": 1 or another appropriate number
        - NEVER include strings for numerical fields
        - NEVER add extra fields not shown in the example below

        Note: you will also give a **short video** tutorial of that exercise only for eg. if the exercise is "hanging leg raises" you will only give video of "hanging leg raises" instead of videos like "complete abs workout",. Note: only give valid youtbue tutorials that exist and you will ensure that you only give the tutorial of that exercise for example if the exercise is "dumbbell chest press" you wilil only give tutorial of "dumbbell chest press" only and not "dumbbell fly or barbell press". And you will give the embed link like "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCufdom7xgY?si=orc_oLtX70Y7xxIh"Â  instead of original one.
